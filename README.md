# Titanic-ML-Project

Hello!

You will find in this repository a Machine Learning project whose objective is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic after her sinking. The data I used is available on the Kaggle platform in the frame of one its competitions.

I worked on this project with the intention to practice my skills – some I have acquired over the years and new ones I have more recently gained. The Jupyter Notebook I created is therefore not just a juxtaposition of code but rather a deeper dive into my thought process. My first predictions were shared on Kaggle and scored 0.75119. I am now looking at improving the predictive model to reach a score of 0.80 or more.

Please don't hesitate to contribute to this project by sharing some advice or ideas – I am always up for learning new things :)
